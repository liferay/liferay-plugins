It appears as at the bottom of every page, and displays who is logged on, their statuses, and any chats the logged-in user has open. Users can also set audio alerts, and engage in multiple chats. Consult the “Chat” section of the Liferay User Guide for details on administering this service. The Liferay User Guide can be found at http://liferay.com/documentation.<br /><br />This app may appear at the bottom of the page.
