long-description=The Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP) specification defines a web service interface for accessing and interacting with interactive presentation-oriented web services in the form of portlets. Using this app, Liferay acts as a WSRP Producer, hosting portlets that will be consumed by other portal servers acting as WSRP Consumers. Liferay can also act as a WSRP Consumer, and host remote instances of portlets that exist on other portal servers that can act as a WSRP Producer. For details on how to use this app, visit http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/WSRP.<br /><br />This app will appear in your Control Panel once installed.
