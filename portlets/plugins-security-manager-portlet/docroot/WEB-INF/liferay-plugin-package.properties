short-description=
long-description=The main function of the Plugins Security Manager is to protect the portal and host system from malicious code. The Plugins Security Manager checks an apps's API access attempt against the security manager properties specified in a plugin's liferay-plugin-package.properties file. If an app tries to access a portal resource without having the property "security-manager-enabled" in the liferay-plugin-package.properties file, the Plugins Security Manager prevents this access. This app allows you to disable the Plugins Security Manager so that it does not enforce these security checks.<br /><br />This app will appear in your Control Panel once installed.
