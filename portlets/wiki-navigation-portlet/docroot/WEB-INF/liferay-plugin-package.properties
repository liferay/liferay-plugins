short-description=
long-description=This app provides additional ways to visualize the structure of wiki contents. It provides two different views into a wiki, including a "Page" view and a "Tree" view. The Page View visually lays out the structure of a single wiki page, allowing users to quickly access different sections of a specific wiki page based on the header levels and other authoring capabilities of a wiki page. Each section is individual collapsible. The Tree View presents a hierarchical, expandable and collapsible view of the entire set of Wiki pages. Pages are shown below their "Parent" pages, and the depth of this view can be controlled through the configuration screen of the portlet.<br /><br />This app will appear in your Application menu once installed.
