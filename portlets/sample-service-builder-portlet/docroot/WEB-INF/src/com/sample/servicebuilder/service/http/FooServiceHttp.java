 * This class provides a HTTP utility for the <code>com.sample.servicebuilder.service.FooServiceUtil</code>
 * service utility. The static methods of this class calls the same methods of the
 * service utility. However, the signatures are different because it requires an
 * additional <code>com.liferay.portal.security.auth.HttpPrincipal</code> parameter.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The benefits of using the HTTP utility is that it is fast and allows for tunneling
 * without the cost of serializing to text. The drawback is that it only works with
 * Java.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Set the property <code>tunnel.servlet.hosts.allowed</code> in portal.properties
 * to configure security.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The HTTP utility is only generated for remote services.
