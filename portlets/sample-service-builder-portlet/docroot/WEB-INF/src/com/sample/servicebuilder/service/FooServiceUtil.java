 * This class provides static methods for the

 * bean. The static methods of this class calls the same methods of the bean
 * instance. It's convenient to be able to just write one line to call a method
 * on a bean instead of writing a lookup call and a method call.

 *
 * <p>
 * <code>com.sample.servicebuilder.service.FooServiceFactory</code>
 * is responsible for the lookup of the bean.
