long-description=This IP Geocoder app locates your geological position, often in conjunction with other apps, such as the Google Maps app.<br /><br />This app utilizes Max Mind's GeoIP City Database. IP geolocation can be performed by associating a geographic location with the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user with a physical address. Geolocation usually works by automatically looking up an IP address on a WHOIS service and retrieving the registrant's physical address.<br /><br />This app will appear in your Application menu once installed.
