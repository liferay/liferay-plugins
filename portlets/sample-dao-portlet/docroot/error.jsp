An unexpected error occurred.

Please check that these database settings are correct:

<br /><br />

<%
Properties props = ConnectionPool.getProperties();

Enumeration enu = props.propertyNames();

while (enu.hasMoreElements()) {
	String key = (String)enu.nextElement();

	String value = props.getProperty(key);
%>

	<strong><%= key %></strong>=<%= value%><br />

<%
}
%>

<br />

You can change the database settings by modifying /WEB-INF/classes/connection-pool.properties.
