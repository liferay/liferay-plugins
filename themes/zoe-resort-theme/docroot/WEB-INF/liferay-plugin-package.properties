long-description=Zoe Resort utilizes a clean layout structure and large dedicated image spaces catering to the needs of the hotel and resort industry, with prominent banners throughout. The theme features a 3-3-3 columns layout, an image carousel, breadcrumbs, featured content, and footer social network links. We utilize a customizable “advanced footer” that includes a text blurb, footer navigation, footer links and social networking links. In the advanced footer you are able to replace any section with web content using a uniquely generated article ID.<br /><br />This layout will appear in your Page Settings, under Available Themes once installed.
