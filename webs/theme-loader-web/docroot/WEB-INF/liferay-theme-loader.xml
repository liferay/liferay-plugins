	<!--
	The themes-path element tells the theme loader where to store the themes inside
	the exploded WAR. This is also the path used to prefix the root-path of all
	themes loaded by this theme loader. The default is "/themes".
	-->

	<!--
	<themes-path>/themes</themes-path>
	-->

	<!--
	The file-storage element tells the theme loader where to store the files. If
	this element is not set, then it will store the files inside the exploded WAR's
	"themes" directory or inside the directory set by the element themes-path. If
	this element is set, it expects a full path to an external directory.
