long-description=This app provides remote development and deployment support from Liferay IDE. With this app, you can build Liferay projects in Liferay IDE or Liferay Developer Studio, and deploy the projects to a remote host that has this app installed. Liferay IDE is an extension for the Eclipse platform that supports development of app projects for the Liferay Portal platform. It is available as a set of Eclipse apps installable from an update-site. The latest version supports developing 5 Liferay app types: portlets, hooks, layout templates, themes, and EXT-style plug-ins. Liferay IDE requires the Eclipse Java EE developer package using either Galileo or Helios versions. For details on using Liferay IDE or Developer Studio, visit the "Liferay IDE" chapter of the Liferay User Guide, located at http://liferay.com/documentation.<br /><br />This app installs as a Liferay service.
