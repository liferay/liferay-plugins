long-description=The Resources Importer app allows front-end developers to package web content, portlet configurations, and layouts together in a theme without saving it as a compiled .LAR file thereby allowing for greater flexibility in its usage between Liferay Portal versions.<br /><br />This app will automatically create associated content when other plugins are deployed that are configured to make use of the Resource Importer app.<br /><br />This app installs as a Liferay service.
