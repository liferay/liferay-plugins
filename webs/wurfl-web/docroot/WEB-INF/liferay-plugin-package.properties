long-description=This app enables Liferay to detect which mobile device or operating system is being used for any given request and alters the layout/rendering of pages based on the detected device. Once installed, you can define new mobile device rules and apply them to sites and individual pages. The proportion of mobile devices users browsing the web has been steadily increasing so it's important to be able to handle different kinds of devices appropriately. For instance, you can configure the look and feel of Liferay pages accessed by smart phone or tablet users differently than those accessed by PC users. Both sites and individual pages can be configured with any number of rule groups designed to describe a group of devices. It can contain one or more rules that describe a category of devices, such as all android devices or all iOS tablets. Rule groups can be prioritized to determine which one will be applied to a given page request. You can define as many rules as you need to classify all the devices you want to take actions on.<br /><br />This app installs as a Liferay service.
