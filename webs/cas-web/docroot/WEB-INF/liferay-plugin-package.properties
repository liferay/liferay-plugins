short-description=
long-description=The Central Authentication Service (CAS) is a single sign-on protocol for the web that permits a user to access multiple applications while providing their credentials (such as user id and password) only once. It also allows web applications to authenticate users without gaining access to a user's security credentials, such as a password. This app provides integration between Liferay and a CAS implementation, such that users can achieve Single Sign-On when visiting a Liferay site.<br /><br />This app will install to your application server or servlet container.
