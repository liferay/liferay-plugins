short-description=
long-description=The Central Authentication Service (CAS) is a single sign-on protocol for the web that permits a user to access multiple applications while providing their credentials (such as user id and password) only once. It also allows web applications to authenticate users without gaining access to a user's security credentials, such as a password.<br /><br />This app provides integration between Liferay and a CAS implementation, such that users can achieve Single Sign-On when visiting a Liferay site. Consult the "Managing Portal Settings" section of the Liferay User Guide for details on administering this service. The Liferay User Guide can be found at http://liferay.com/documentation.<br /><br />This app will install to your application server or servlet container.
