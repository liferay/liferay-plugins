long-description=This app adds additional social bookmarks to Liferay's built-in set of Social Bookmarks. These bookmarks can be used by custom apps, and are also used by Liferay's built-in apps such as its Blogs portlet. Social Bookmarks allow users to easily post a reference to Liferay content on their favorite social networking website. In addition, some websites offer counters that can immediately show users how many people have bookmarked a particular piece of user-generated content.
