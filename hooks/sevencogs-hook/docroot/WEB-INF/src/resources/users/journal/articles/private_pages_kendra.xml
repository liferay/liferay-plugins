				<img alt="" src="/html/js/editor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lightbulb.gif" /> Kendra&#39;s Private Page
			</h2>

			<p>
				These are my private pages. Only I can see them, edit them and create new ones.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Social Space - Shows my friends and their activities.
				</li>
				<li>
					Work Space - Has my calendar, documents, images, and other work related content.
				</li>
				<li>
					Email - I can configure this page to view my email.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				To add more applications just go to the <a href="http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/1071674/Dockbar/maximized" target="_blank"><em>Dockbar</em></a> and click on the <strong>&quot;+ Add&quot;</strong> button. It should bring out a menu, from there, you'll be able to add pages and applications.

			<h3>
				Third Party Widgets:
			</h3>

			<p>
				You can also add widgets from any other website. I have already added a widget for facebook which was very easy, by following these steps:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					On the Dockbar, click on the &quot;+ Add&quot; button then the &rarr; <strong>&quot;More...&quot;</strong> selection, from there you can search for the &quot;iframe&quot; portlet
				</li>
				<li>
					After adding the application, go to the Configuration menu (Cog shaped icon of the portlet when borders are hidden, or the wrench icon) and set the Url to the third party widget, in our case, we used: <a href="http://iphone.facebook.com">http://iphone.facebook.com</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					Click on &quot;Save,&quot; then refresh the page
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				With this method, you'll be able to use almost any page designed for the iPhone as a widget in your Liferay Portal instance.
