				The current page is the default page each user first sees when he gets to your portal. By default, unauthenticated users are Guest users, so they are redirected to the guest site: <a href="/web/guest/">@portal_url@/web/guest/</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				You can create any number of sites within the portal which will have their own public and private pages. One site for the <a href="/web/7cogs">7cogs</a> organization has already been created.
