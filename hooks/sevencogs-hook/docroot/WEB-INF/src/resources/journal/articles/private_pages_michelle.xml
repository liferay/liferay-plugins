			These are my private pages. Only I can see them, edit them and create new ones.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Social Space - Shows my friends and their activities.</li>
			<li>Work Space - Has my calendar, documents, images...</li>
			<li>Email - I can configure this page to view my emails.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			To add more applications just go to the dock menu and select Add Application.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also add widgets from any other website. I have already added a widget for twitter which was very easy, by following these steps:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Add Application --&gt; iframe portlet</li>
			<li>Go to Configuration of the portlet and set the Url to <a href="https://twitterforiphone.com/login">https://twitterforiphone.com/login</a>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Any mobile web application or widget for the iphone will work perfectly in your instance of Liferay Portal using this method.
