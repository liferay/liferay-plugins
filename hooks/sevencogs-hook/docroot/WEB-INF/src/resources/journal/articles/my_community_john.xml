			This is my personal space (My Community). I have 2 <strong>public pages</strong>: Profile and Blog. Everybody can see these pages by going to <a href="/web/jon">@portal_url@/web/jon</a> but only I can modify the content in them. I can create more public pages (Add page) and add more applications to those pages in the dock menu (Add Aplication).
		</p>
		<p>
			I also have some <strong>private pages</strong> that only I can see (my socialSpace, my workSpace and my email). In order to access them I have to go to the dock menu --&gt; My Places --&gt; My community --&gt; Private Pages or go to <a href="/user/jon">@portal_url@/user/jon</a> when I am logged in.
